ocp-vscode
==========

See: `ocp-vscode <https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer>`_
(formerly known as cq_vscode)

Watch John Degenstein create three build123d designs being created in realtime with Visual 
Studio Code and the ocp-vscode viewer in a timed event from the TooTallToby 2023 Leadership 
Challenge: 
`build123d May 2023 TooTallToby Leaderboard Challenge <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8aW27jEiw>`_

bd_warehouse
============

On-demand generation of parametric parts that seamlessly integrate into
build123d projects.

Parts available include:

    * fastener - Nuts, Screws, Washers and custom holes
    * flange - Standardized parametric flanges
    * pipe - Standardized parametric pipes
    * thread - Parametric helical threads (Iso, Acme, Plastic, etc.)

See: `bd_warehouse <https://bd-warehouse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

Superellipses & Superellipsoids
===============================

Superellipses are a more sophisticated alternative to rounded
rectangles, with smoothly changing curvature. They are flexible
shapes that can be adjusted by changing the "exponent" to get a
result that varies between rectangular and elliptical, or from
square, through squircle, to circle, and beyond...

Superellipses can be found:

  * in typefaces such as Melior, Eurostyle, and Computer Modern
  * as the shape of airliner windows, tables, plates
  * clipping the outline of iOS app icons

They were named and popularized in the 1950s-1960s by the Danish
mathematician and poet Piet Hein, who used them in the winning
design for the Sergels Torg roundabout in Stockholm.
